        <h2> So you wanna build a drone?</h2>

    <p> "Drones" can be described as basically any robot that receives 
        its controls remotely. An operator sends controls with a transmitter
        to the drone's Reciever, resulting in the appropriate output from the drone.
        </p>
        <p>Most people hear the word "Drone" and think of the quadcopters used in
            the Drone Racing League, naturally. The ones used in these kinds of events
            are Built to spec, meaning each one is exactly the same. Spec racing 
            is focused on removing as many variables from the competition as possible.
            Pilot skill is the only thing that matters in Spec racing, which makes for 
            high stakes racing where miliseconds can mean everything.
        </p>
        <p><h3>We ARENT building a spec racer</h3></p>
        
        <p>Trash spec would be a blast, actually... Gather The following to make a sick drone.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Flight Controller</li>
            <li>Frame</li>
            <li>Motors/ESC</li>
            <li>FPV system</li>
        </ul>

        <p><h4>Flight Controller</h4></p>
        <p>This is the brains of the operation. A hobby-grade flight controller will include sensors
            like barometers, <a href="../pages/gyro.html">gyroscopes.</a> and magnetometers. They will also have
        a varying number of I/O pins depending on the quality of the board. Purchase and flash a hobby-grade Flight Controller
        with software like Betaflight or iNav to have a fully customizeable experience.</p>

        <p>For the handsy DIy-ER, flight control boards can be pulled from all kinds of remote toys and 
            put into use in a custom build. Many toy quadcopters use a very similar motor and battery type,
            so most items are interchangeable when it gets down to it. These boards cannot be flashed with software, 
            they come with their programming locked in. This means you should also have the original transmitter to have the 
            most fun.
        </p>

        <p><h4>Frame</h4></p>

        <p>High end drones like the ones you see zipping around the race track and diving skyscrapers make use 
            of very strong materials. Carbon Fiber is very strong and lightweight, and has been used for years
            to get the best results for model aircraft enthusiasts. Depending on your budget, you can find precut
            multicopter frames in all kinds of configurations. <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a>
            is a really neat place to look for printable frame designs should you have access to a 3d printer or printing service
        </p>

        <p> This is another part of the build that could be found just around anywhere. popsicle sticks and hotglue 
            have made a lot of fine flying craft over the years. When building a DIy frame, airflow from the propellors should be
            obstructed as little as possible. This is why popsicle sticks are a pretty good option over something like a 
            pizza box.
