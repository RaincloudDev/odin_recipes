        <h1>Dr. Labcoat's Wonderful World of Wonder</h1>
        <p>This is an ongoing project started in July 2022. The project was started as the first assignment in The Odin Project
            curriculum. Dr Labcoat and all associates are fictional characters created for a tiktok series. The pages and content
            here will continue to evolve over time as I put skills into practice.
